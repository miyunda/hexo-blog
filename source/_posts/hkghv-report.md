Renaissance Harbour View Hotel (the hotel) is located Wan Chai North, Hong Kong Island. Indicated by its name, the hotel showcases panoramic Victoria Harbour view to Kowloon Peninsula. ![02_location](https://cdn.beijing2b.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/02_location.png)

The hotel is adjacent to the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC). There are many top-rated attractions nearby. Also guests can walk to MTR Wanchai station or famous [Star Ferry](http://www.starferry.com.hk/en/service). Since it is near central business district, it might be considered as a perfect place for business travellers, but I still chose it for leisure. My typical travels are to spend days at hotel and treat myself to views. ![60](https://cdn.beijing2b.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/60-1.jpg)

The hotel is invested by New World Development Company Limited (NWD) and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA). They have twin buildings there, one is managed by Marriott, the other is by Hyatt (Grand Hyatt Hong Kong).The hotel started operations from 1989, and I believe it had been renovated recently. ![03_ Exterior_b](https://cdn.beijing2b.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/03_-Exterior_b.jpg)

The building has 42 floors, includes about 800 rooms, with heated pools, courts, fitness centre and restaurants. The reception is at upper lobby. The CI process was really fast, and they adjust dynamically to reduce queue length/save workforce. There was an event, [TTS 2016](http://tts2016.org/), so I saw all of shift members were helping. Also saw many captain/pilot/cabin crew there. The receptionists are trained well, nice and warm. ![04_lobby_a](https://cdn.beijing2b.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/04_lobby_a.jpg)

My 3-year son received a toy football as welcome-gift from guest service manager (GSM), my wife also got a gift from her. And she escorted us to the room, introduced facilities and services. ![05_room_a](https://cdn.beijing2b.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/05_room_a.jpg)

I didn't listen to her at all, since the view took my breath away. ![05_room_f](https://cdn.beijing2b.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/05_room_f.jpg)

Fairly the room is not large as other hotels' I stayed, but how big do you want on this land-scarce island? ![05_room_b](https://cdn.beijing2b.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/05_room_b.jpg)

Umbrella is provided in room, you don't have to borrow one from lobby.  Nespresso/tea is provided. There was no fruits in room. There was no handwritten welcome-card. ![06_room_a](https://cdn.beijing2b.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/06_room_a.jpg)

Toiletries, shampoo/conditioner/salt/soaps are Tokyo Milk, toothpastes are by Colgate. Had to wait for about 20 seconds when shower, it was not fast. ![05_room_i](https://cdn.beijing2b.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/05_room_i.jpg)

Both bedroom and sitting room has a 48-inch SamSung TV, running hotel customized Android, programs are still in SD format. Internet access (WIFI) was fast and stable. Dehumidifier works perfectly. ![05_room_g](https://cdn.beijing2b.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/05_room_g.jpg)

Bathroom lock malfunctioned and my wife got locked inside, alone. As an expert of lock picking, she studied the lock for seconds, then decided to call service.  A worker arrived in 10 minutes and removed the lock by means of “brute force”, of course the door was damaged. Thank him for didn't have the entire hotel demolished. Café Renaissance is where the breakfast provided, it is not large so you may have to wait for seats in peak hours, Food was superb! We even enjoyed brunch at weekends. Dynasty is a Michelin-starred restaurant, serving authentic Cantonese fare. This is highly recommended if you live in this hotel. Non-alcoholic drinks are in the club lounge, floor 40 and 41.There are dessert selections afternoon, including cake/pie/cookie/Häagen-Dazs. When sunset, happy hour begins with white/red wine, vintage champagne, cocktail, beers and "snacks", sausage/pasta/wing/salads... ![09_fb_d](https://cdn.beijing2b.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/09_fb_d.jpg)
